Zip file is transmitted to ``projectdownload.ctl`` CTRL as a blob in ``filedata`` DPE allowing to use the project uploader in an architecture composed of a Remote Http Server and a WinCC OA Server.

In case of multiple servers (distribution, remote proxy, dedicated http server), the blob of ZIP file is sent to all DPE of DPT ``PROJECT_DOWNLOAD``. This allows to sent a ZIP file with new scripts, panels, pictures and deploy them everywhere.

A special file ``pmondeploy.txt`` case be sent in ``config`` folder or sub-folder by hostname and could contains a list of Pmon commands.
